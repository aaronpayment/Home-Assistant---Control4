# Home-Assistant---Control4

These files will enable you to use the Control4 (4) Zone Matrix Amplifier and Control4 tuner in Home Assistant without the need of the Control4 Controller itself. I no longer use the Control4 system (with the exception of the AMP and Tuner which I like).

These files are written specifically for my setup, but can be modified easily to accomidate your setup. This is based on a Control 4 (4) Zone Matrix Amplifier and Control4 Tuner (Tuner 1, Tuner 2), but since I've never used XM I have no writeup for that. This is based on what Matt from Smart(ish)Home orginally did with OpenHab and Home Assistant (this wouldn't have been possible without his work), and a few others who gave me pointers and fixes (thanks Walrus_Parka).
